Rejoining the team at Innovasium for the summer of 2017 lead to an even greater
learning experience than the last. I was exposed to a technology stack I had
never worked with before and quickly became adept at one of the most popular
frameworks at the time. They also leveraged my experience using Rails to work
on a new client project for not only the product's API but also for frontend
development.
