## Notable Contributions

- Learned and developed with React on a large, pre-existing client application
  to maintain and extend functionality
- Leveraged Redux and ImmutableJS for clean application state and purely
  functional data mutations
- Extended my previous work on the Rails API to implement new endpoints,
  alongside sharding the database to add new instances of the application as
  needed
- Gained exposure to Docker images and builds, ran local versions of the client
  application inside of Docker containers
- Queried against the Microsoft Sharepoint API for data analysis, file upload
  and download, as well as extend Microsoft's functionality to create an internal
  file inventory
- Utilized the HAML markup language and the Rails MCV architecture to bug fix
  and create new user interfaces for [SeeWhatSheCanDo](seewhatshecando.com).

## The Position in Review

Rejoining the team at Innovasium for the summer of 2017 lead to an even greater
learning experience than the last. I was exposed to a technology stack I had
never worked with before and quickly became adept at one of the most popular
frameworks at the time. They also leveraged my experience using Rails to work
on a new client project for not only the product's API but also for front end
development.
