## Position in Review

Throughout the summer of 2016, I had the opportunity to work for the team at
Innovasium Digital. I was responsible for designing and implementing the initial
RESTful API architecture for a large client web application using Ruby on Rails.
The work culture along with having a small team size allowed for rapid prototyping
and client feedback for reiterating over our product.
